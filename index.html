        <h2>Texas History</h2>
        <p>In 1821, Mexico gained independence from Spain, and Texas became part of the new Mexican Republic. Initially, Mexico encouraged American settlers to move to Texas to bolster its sparsely populated frontier. By the early 1830s, tensions grew between the predominantly Anglo settlers and the Mexican government, leading to conflicts over issues such as slavery and governance. In 1836, after a series of confrontations, Texas declared its independence, resulting in the formation of the Republic of Texas. The Republic, under leaders like Sam Houston, faced internal challenges and external threats, particularly from Mexico, which did not immediately recognize Texas' independence.</p>
        <p>In 1845, the U.S. annexed Texas, leading to a dispute with Mexico that culminated in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). The war ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ceded vast territories, including present-day California and New Mexico, to the U.S., and formally recognized Texas' boundaries. During the 1850s and 1860s, Texas experienced growth but also deepening sectional divides over issues such as slavery, contributing to its secession from the Union in 1861 and joining the Confederacy during the Civil War.</p>
        <p>After the Union victory in 1865, Texas underwent Reconstruction, a tumultuous period marked by efforts to integrate formerly enslaved people into society and rebuild its economy and infrastructure. The state faced significant challenges during Reconstruction, including political strife and resistance to federal policies, but eventually, it began to recover and reintegrate into the Union by the early 1870s.</p>
